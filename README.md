# Crypto Technical Analysis

This is simple UI project for Technical Analysis API - check out the [documentation](https://technical-analysis-api.herokuapp.com/documentation).  
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to preview the app

I posted the application on [Github Pages](https://kowalskikoduje.github.io/crypto-ta/), but then it turned out that the API is blocking connection to other domains (CORS), when only free tier is enabled. However, the connection from localhost is not blocked.  

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Run this command to install all required dependencies.

### `npm start`

This command runs the app in the development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run deploy`

This command allows you to deploy app on Github Pages but as previously mentioned the free api version is blocking the connection (CORS).
